Welcome to the NCBI python program 'ncbi.py'.
The program will search the dbSNP, a database on NCBI servers for known SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in specific genes. 
The program is to be used through your terminal, and it's purpose is to search for SNPs with a specific term (ie a gene of interest, but you can also ask for a specific disease).
The return will be a CSV file with the number of rows you requested, the SNP_ID (for each specific SNP in the db there's an ID), GLOBAL_MAF (prevalence in the population) and CHRPOS (chromosome and position on build Hg38 of the human genome).
The terms should be as follows
'ncbi.pi term number'

Best of luck with your research!
